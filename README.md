# Loan Data Project

For this project I'm using a kaggle dataset from [Lending Club, a US lender](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). I will use this dataset to create a classifier to predict the loan status (fully paid or charged off). Once the data has been cleaned, this results in a class imbalance of approximately 80:20.
